<p style="margin-top: 2em">Some of you whose avocations call them, from time to time, to Newmarket
may have noted, at a little distance out from Cambridge, a by-road
advertised as leading to Quy and Swaffham. It also leads to the site of
an old Roman villa; but you need not interrupt your business to visit
this, since the best thing discovered there—a piece of tessellated
pavement—has been removed and deposited in the Geological Museum here in
Downing Street, where you may study it very conveniently. It is not at
all a first-class specimen of its kind: not to be compared, for example,
with the wonderful pavement at Dorchester, or with that (measuring 35
feet by 20) of the great villa unearthed, a hundred years ago, at
Stonesfield in Oxfordshire: but I take it as the handiest, and am going
to build a small conjecture upon it, or rather a small suggestion of a
guess. Remember there is no harm in guessing so long as we do not pretend
our guess-work to be something else.</p>

<p>I will ask you to consider first that in these pavements, laid bare for
us as 'the whistling rustic tends his plough,' we have work dating
somewhere between the first and fifth centuries, work of unchallengeable
beauty, work of a beauty certainly not rivalled until we come to the
Norman builders of five or six hundred years later. I want you to let
your minds dwell on these long stretches of time—four hundred years or
so of Roman occupation (counting, not from Cæsar's raids, but from the
serious invasion of 43 A.D. under Aulus Plautius, say to some while after
the famous letter of Honorius, calling home the legions). You may safely
put it at four hundred years, and then count six hundred as the space
before the Normans arrive—a thousand years altogether, or but a
fraction—one short generation—less than the interval of time that
separates us from King Alfred. In the great Cathedral of Winchester
(where sleep, by the way, two gentle writers specially beloved, Isaak
Walton and Jane Austen) above the choir-screen to the south, you may see
a line of painted chests, of which the inscription on one tells you that
it holds what was mortal of King Canute.</p>

<p>     Here are sands, ignoble things,<br/>

     Dropp'd from the ruin'd sides of Kings.<br/>
</p>

<p>But if you walk around to the north of the altar you will find yourself
treading on tiles not so very far short of twice that antiquity.
Gentlemen, do not think that I would ever speak lightly of our lineage:
only let us make as certain as we may what that lineage is.</p>

<p>I want you to-day to understand just what such a pavement as that
preserved for your inspection in Downing Street meant to the man who saw
it laid and owned it these fifteen hundred years—more or less—ago. <i>Ubi
Romanus vicit, ibi habitat</i>—'where the Roman has conquered, there he
settles': but whether he conquered or settled he carried these small
tiles, these <i>tessellæ</i>, as religiously as ever Rachel stole her
teraphin. 'Wherever his feet went there went the tessellated pavement for
them to stand on. Even generals on foreign service carried in panniers on
muleback the little coloured cubes or <i>tessellæ</i> for laying down a
pavement in each camping-place, to be taken up again when they moved
forward. In England the same sweet emblems of the younger gods of poetic
legend, of love, youth, plenty, and all their happy naturalism, are found
constantly repeated.'[1] I am quoting these sentences from a local
historian, but you see how these relics have a knack of inspiring prose
at once scholarly and imaginative, as (for a more famous instance) the
urns disinterred at Walsingham once inspired Sir Thomas Browne's. To
continue and adapt the quotation—</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Bacchus with his wild rout, Orpheus playing to a spell-bound audience,
  Apollo singing to the lyre, Venus in Mars' embrace, Neptune with a host
  of seamen, scollops, and trumpets, Narcissus by the fountain, Jove and
  Ganymede, Leda and the swan, wood-nymphs and naiads, satyrs and fauns,
  masks, hautboys, cornucopiæ, flowers and baskets of golden fruit—what
  touches of home they must have seemed to these old dwellers in the
  Cambridgeshire wilds!</p>

<p>Yes, touches of home! For the owner of this villa (you may conceive) is
the grandson or even great-great-grandson of the colonist who first built
it, following in the wake of the legionaries. The family has prospered
and our man is now a considerable landowner. He was born in Britain: his
children have been born here: and here he lives a comfortable,
well-to-do, out-of-door life, in its essentials I daresay not so very
unlike the life of an English country squire to-day. Instead of chasing
foxes or hares he hunts the wolf and the wild boar; but the sport is
good and he returns with an appetite. He has added a summer parlour to
the house, with a northern aspect and no heating-flues: for the old
parlour he has enlarged the præfurnium, and through the long winter
evenings sits far better warmed than many a master of a modern
country-house. A belt of trees on the brow of the rise protects him from
the worst winds, and to the south his daughters have planted violet-beds
which will breathe odorously in the spring. He has rebuilt and enlarged
the slave-quarters and outhouses, replaced the stucco pillars around the
atrium with a colonnade of polished stone, and, where stucco remains,
has repainted it in fresh colours. He knows that there are no gaps or
weak spots in his stockade fence—wood is always cheap. In a word he has
improved the estate; is modestly proud of it; and will be content, like
the old Athenian, to leave his patrimony not worse but something better
than he found it.</p>

<p>Sensible men—and the Romans were eminently that—as a rule contrive to
live decently, or, at least, tolerably. What struck Arthur Young more
than anything else in his travels through France on the very eve of the
Revolution seems to have been the general good-tempered happiness of the
French gentry on their estates. We may moralise of the Roman colonists as
of the French proprietors that 'unconscious of their doom the little
victims played'; but we have no right to throw back on them the shadow of
what was to come or to cloud the picture of a useful, peaceable, maybe
more than moderately happy life, with our later knowledge of disaster
mercifully hidden from it.</p>

<p>Although our colonist and his family have all been born in Britain, are
happy enough here on the whole, and talk without more than half meaning
it, and to amuse themselves with speculations half-wistful, of daring the
tremendous journey and setting eyes on Rome some day, their pride is to
belong to her, to Rome, the imperial City, the city afar: their windows
open back towards her as Daniel's did towards Jerusalem—<i>Urbs quam
dicunt Roman—the</i> City. Along the great road, hard by, her imperial writ
runs. They have never subscribed to the vow of Ruth, 'Thy people shall be
my people and thy God my God.' They dwell under the Pax Romana, not
merely protected by it but as <i>citizens</i>. Theirs are the ancestral
deities portrayed on that unfading pavement in the very centre of the
villa—Apollo and Daphne, Bacchus and Ariadne—</p>

<p>     For ever warm and still to be enjoyed,<br/>

     For ever panting, and for ever young.<br/>
</p>

<p>Parcels come to them, forwarded from the near military station; come by
those trade-routes, mysterious to us, concerning which a most
illuminating book waits to be written by somebody. There are parcels of
seeds—useful vegetables and potherbs, helichryse (marigold as we call
them now) for the flower garden, for the colonnade even roses with real
Italian earth damp about their roots. There are parcels of books,
too—rolls rather, or tablets—wherein the family reads about Rome; of
its wealth, the uproar of its traffic, the innumerable chimneys smoking,
<i>fumum et opes strepitumque</i>. For they are always reading of Rome;
feeling themselves, as they read, to belong to it, to be neither savage
nor even rustic, but by birthright <i>of the city</i>, urbane; and what these
exiles read is of how Horace met a bore on the Sacred Road (which would
correspond, more or less, with our Piccadilly)—</p>

<p>     Along the Sacred Road I strolled one day<br/>

     Deep in some bagatelle (you know my way)<br/>

     When up comes one whose face I scarcely knew—<br/>

     'The dearest of dear fellows! how d'ye do?'<br/>

     —He grasped my hand. 'Well, thanks! The same to you?'<br/>
</p>

<p>—or of how Horace apologises for protracting a summer jaunt to his
country seat:—</p>

<p>     Five days I told you at my farm I'd stay,<br/>

     And lo! the whole of August I'm away.<br/>

     Well but, Maecenas, you would have me live,<br/>

     And, were I sick, my absence you'd forgive.<br/>

     So let me crave indulgence for the fear<br/>

     Of falling ill at this bad time of year.<br/>

     When, thanks to early figs and sultry heat,<br/>

     The undertaker figures with his suite;<br/>

     When fathers all and fond mammas grow pale<br/>

     At what may happen to their young heirs male,<br/>

     And courts and levees, town-bred mortals' ills,<br/>

     Bring fevers on, and break the seals of wills.<br/>
</p>

<p>                    (Conington's translation.)</p>

<p>Consider those lines; then consider how long it took the inhabitants
of this island—the cultured ones who count as readers or
writers—to recapture just that note of urbanity. Other things
our forefathers —Britons, Saxons, Normans, Dutch or French
refugees—discovered by the way; worthier things if you will; but not
until the eighteenth century do you find just that note recaptured; the
note of easy confidence that our London had become what Rome had been,
the Capital city. You begin to meet it in Dryden; with Addison it is
fairly established. Pass a few years, and with Samuel Johnson it is
taken for granted. His <i>London</i> is Juvenal's Rome, and the same satire
applies to one as applied to the other. But against the urbane lines
written by one Horace some while before Juvenal let us set a passage
from another Horace—Horace Walpole, seventeen hundred years later and
some little while ahead of Johnson. He, like our Roman colonist, is a
settler in a new country, Twickenham; and like Flaccus he loves to
escape from town life.</p>

<p>                          TWICKENHAM, June 8th, 1747.</p>

<p>   To the Hon. H. S. CONWAY.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   You perceive by my date that I am got into a new camp, and have left
   my tub at Windsor. It is a little plaything-house that I got out of
   Mrs Chevenix's shop, and the prettiest bauble you ever saw. It is set
   in enamelled meadows with filagree hedges:</p>

<p>       A small Euphrates through the place is roll'd,<br/>

       And little finches wave their wings of gold.<br/>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   Two delightful roads; that you would call dusty, supply me continually
   with coaches and chaises: barges as solemn as Barons of the Exchequer
   move under my window; Richmond Hill and Ham Walks bound my prospect;
   but, thank God! the Thames is between me and the Duchess of
   Queensberry. Dowagers as plenty as flounders inhabit all around, and
   Pope's ghost is just now skimming under my window by the most poetical
   moonlight…. The Chevenixes had tricked it out for themselves; up two
   pairs of stairs is what they call Mr Chevenix's library, furnished
   with three maps, one shelf, a bust of Sir Isaac Newton and a lame
   telescope without any glasses. Lord John Sackville <i>predeceased</i> me
   here and instituted certain games called <i>cricketalia</i>, which has been
   celebrated this very evening in honour of him in a neighbouring
   meadow.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   You will think I have removed my philosophy from Windsor with my
   tea-things hither; for I am writing to you in all tranquility while a
   Parliament is bursting about my ears. You know it is going to be
   dissolved…. They say the Prince has taken up two hundred thousand
   pounds, to carry elections which he won't carry—he had much better
   have saved it to buy the Parliament after it is chosen.</p>

<p>There you have Horatio Walpole, the man-about-town, almost precisely
echoing Horatius Flaccus, the man-about-town; and this (if you will bring
your minds to it) is just the sort of passage a Roman colonist in Britain
would open upon, out of his parcel of new books, and read, <i>and
understand</i>, some eighteen hundred years ago.</p>

<p>What became of it all?—of that easy colonial life, of the men and women
who trod those tessellated pavements? 'Wiped out,' say the historians,
knowing nothing, merely guessing: for you may with small trouble assure
yourselves that the fifth and sixth centuries in the story of this island
are a blind spot, concerning which one man's guess may be as good as
another's. 'Wiped out,' they will commonly agree; for while, as I warned
you in another lecture, the pedantic mind, faced with a difficulty, tends
to remove it conveniently into a category to which it does not belong,
still more prone is the pedantic mind to remove it out of existence
altogether. So 'wiped out' is the theory; and upon it a sympathetic
imagination can invent what sorrowful pictures it will of departing
legions, the last little cloud of dust down the highway, the lovers by
the gate watching it, not comprehending; the peaceful homestead in the
background, ripe for doom—and what-not.</p>

<p>Or, stay! There is another theory to which the late Professor Freeman
inclined (if so sturdy a figure could be said to incline), laying stress
on a passage in Gildas, that the Romans in Britain, faced by the Saxon
invader, got together their money, and bolted away into Gaul. 'The Romans
that were in Britain gathered together their gold-hoard, hid part in the
ground and carried the rest over to Gaul,' writes Gildas. 'The hiding in
the ground,' says Freeman, 'is of course a guess to explain the frequent
finding of Roman coins'—which indeed it <i>does</i> explain better than the
guess that they were carried away, and perhaps better than the
schoolboy's suggestion that during their occupation of Britain the Romans
spent most of their time in dropping money about. Likely enough, large
numbers of the colonists did gather up what they could and flee before
the approaching storm; but by no means all, I think. For (since, where
all is uncertain, we must reason from what is probable of human nature)
in the first place men with large estates do not behave in that way
before a danger which creeps upon them little by little, as this Saxon
danger did. These colonists could not dig up their fields and carry them
over to Gaul. They did not keep banking accounts; and in the course of
four hundred years their main wealth had certainly been sunk in the land.
They could not carry away their villas. We know that many of them did not
carry away the <i>tessellæ</i> for which (as we have seen) they had so
peculiar a veneration; for these remain. Secondly, if the colonists left
Britain in a mass, when in the middle of the sixth century we find
Belisarius offering the Goths to trade Britain for Sicily, as being 'much
larger and this long time subservient to Roman rule,'[2] we must suppose
either (as Freeman appears to suppose) that Belisarius did not know what
he was offering, or that he was attempting a gigantic 'bluff,' or lastly
that he really was offering an exchange not flatly derisory; of which
three possible suppositions I prefer the last as the likeliest. Nor am I
the less inclined to choose it, because these very English historians go
on to clear the ground in a like convenient way of the Celtic
inhabitants, exterminating them as they exterminated the Romans,
with a wave of the hand, quite in the fashion of Mr Podsnap. 'This is
un-English: therefore for me it merely ceases to exist.'</p>

<p>'<i>Probable extirpation of the Celtic inhabitants</i>' jots down Freeman in
his margin, and proceeds to write:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%">   In short, though the literal extirpation of a nation is an
   impossibility, there is every reason to believe that the Celtic
   inhabitants of those parts of Britain which had become English at the
   end of the sixth century had been as nearly extinguished as a nation
   could be. The women doubtless would be largely spared, but as far as
   the male sex is concerned we may feel sure that death, emigration, or
   personal slavery were the only alternatives which the vanquished found
   at the hands of our fathers.</p>

<p>Upon this passage, if brought to me in an undergraduate essay, I should
have much to say. The style, with its abstract nouns ('the literal
extirpation of a nation is an impossibility'), its padding and
periphrasis ('there is every reason to believe' … 'as far as the male
sex is concerned we may feel sure') betrays the loose thought. It begins
with 'in short' and proceeds to be long-winded. It commits what even
schoolboys know to be a solecism by inviting us to consider three
'alternatives'; and what can I say of 'the women doubtless would be
largely spared,' save that besides scanning in iambics it says what
Freeman never meant and what no-one outside of an Aristophanic comedy
could ever suggest? 'The women doubtless would be largely spared'! It
reminds me of the young lady in Cornwall who, asked by her vicar if she
had been confirmed, admitted blushingly that 'she had reason to believe,
partially so.'</p>

<p>'The women doubtless would be largely spared'!—But I thank the Professor
for teaching me that phrase, because it tries to convey just what I am
driving at. The Jutes, Angles, Saxons, did not extirpate the Britons,
whatever you may hold concerning the Romans. For, once again, men do not
behave in that way, and certainly will not when a live slave is worth
money. Secondly, the very horror with which men spoke, centuries after,
of Anderida quite plainly indicates that such a wholesale massacre was
exceptional, monstrous. If not exceptional, monstrous, why should this
particular slaughter have lingered so ineffaceably in their memories?
Finally,—and to be as curt as the question deserves—the Celtic Briton
in the island was not exterminated and never came near to being
exterminated: but on the contrary, remains equipollent with the Saxon in
our blood, and perhaps equipollent with that mysterious race we call
Iberian, which came before either and endures in this island to-day, as
anyone travelling it with eyes in his head can see. Pict, Dane, Norman,
Frisian, Huguenot French—these and others come in. If mixture of blood
be a shame, we have purchased at the price of that shame the glory of
catholicism; and I know of nothing more false in science or more actively
poisonous in politics or in the arts than the assumption that we belong
as a race to the Teutonic family.</p>

<p>Dane, Norman, Frisian, French Huguenot—they all come in. And will you
refuse a hearing when I claim that the Roman came in too? Bethink you how
deeply Rome engraved itself on this island and its features. Bethink you
that, as human nature is, no conquering race ever lived or could
live—even in garrison—among a tributary one without begetting children
on it. Bethink you yet further of Freeman's admission that in the
wholesale (and quite hypothetical) general massacre 'the women doubtless
would be largely spared'; and you advance nearer to my point. I see a
people which for four hundred years was permeated by Rome. If you insist
on its being a Teutonic people (which I flatly deny) then you have one
which <i>alone of Teutonic peoples</i> has inherited the Roman gift of
consolidating conquest, of colonising in the wake of its armies; of
driving the road, bridging the ford, bringing the lawless under its
sense of law. I see that this nation of ours concurrently, when it seeks
back to what alone can inspire and glorify these activities, seeks back,
not to any supposed native North, but south to the Middle Sea of our
civilisation and steadily to Italy, which we understand far more easily
than France—though France has helped us times and again. Putting these
things together, I retort upon the ethnologists—for I come from the
West of England, where we suffer incredible things from them—<i>'Semper
ego auditor tantum?'</i> I hazard that the most important thing in our
blood is that purple drop of the imperial murex we derive from Rome.</p>

<p>You must, of course, take this for nothing more than it pretends to be—a
conjecture, a suggestion. I will follow it up with two statements of
fact, neither doubtful nor disputable.</p>

<p>The first is, that when English poetry awoke, long after the Conquest
(or, as I should prefer to put it, after the Crusades) it awoke a new
thing; in its vocabulary as much like Anglo-Saxon poetry as ever you
will, but in metre, rhythm, lilt—and more, in style, feeling,
imaginative play—and yet more again, in knowledge of what it aimed to
be, in the essentials, in the qualities that make Poetry Poetry—as
different from Anglo-Saxon poetry as cheese is from chalk, and as much
more nutritious. Listen to this—</p>

<p>     Bytuene Mershe ant Averil<br/>

     When spray biginnith to spring,<br/>

     The lutel foul hath hire wyl<br/>

     On hire lud to synge:<br/>

     Ich libbe in love-longinge<br/>

     For semlokest of alle thynge,<br/>

     He may me blisse bringe,<br/>

     Icham in hire bandoun.<br/>

       An hendy hap ichabbe y-hent,<br/>

       Ichot from hevene it is me sent,<br/>

       From alle wymmen my love is lent,<br/>

         And lyht on Alisoun.<br/>
</p>

<p>Here you have alliteration in plenty; you even have what some hold to be
the pattern of Anglo-Saxon alliterative verse (though in practice
disregarded, may be, as often as not), the chosen initial used twice in
the first line and once at least in the second:</p>

<p>     From alle wymmen my _l_ove is _l_ent,<br/>

       And _l_yht on A_l_isoun.<br/>
</p>

<p>But if a man cannot see a difference infinitely deeper than any
similarity between this song of Alison and the old Anglo-Saxon verse—<i>a
difference of nature</i>—I must despair of his literary sense.</p>

<p>What has happened? Well, in Normandy, too, and in another tongue, men are
singing much the same thing in the same way:</p>

<p>     A la fontenelle<br/>

     Qui sort seur l'araine,<br/>

     Trouvai pastorella<br/>

     Qui n'iert pas vilaine…<br/>

       Merci, merci, douce Marote,<br/>

       N'oçiez pas vostre ami doux,<br/>
</p>

<p>and this Norman and the Englishman were singing to a new tune, which was
yet an old tune re-set to Europe by the Provence, the Roman Province; by
the troubadours—Pons de Capdeuil, Bernard de Ventadour, Bertrand de
Born, Pierre Vidal, and the rest, with William of Poitou, William of
Poitiers. Read and compare; you will perceive that the note then set
persists and has never perished. Take Giraud de Borneil—</p>

<p>     Bel companhos, si dormetz o velhatz<br/>

     Non dortmatz plus, qu'el jorn es apropchatz—<br/>
</p>

<p>and set it beside a lyric of our day, written without a thought of Giraud
de Borneil—</p>

<p>     Heigh! Brother mine, art a-waking or a-sleeping:<br/>

     Mind'st thou the merry moon a many summers fled?<br/>

     Mind'st thou the green and the dancing and the leaping?<br/>

     Mind'st thou the haycocks and the moon above them creeping?…<br/>
</p>

<p>Or take Bernard de Ventadour's—</p>

<p>     Quand erba vertz, e fuelha par<br/>

     E'l flor brotonon per verjan,<br/>

     E'l rossinhols autet e clar<br/>

     Leva sa votz e mov son chan,<br/>

     Joy ai de luy, e joy ai de la flor,<br/>

     Joy ai de me, e de me dons maior.<br/>
</p>

<p>Why, it runs straight off into English verse—</p>

<p>     When grass is green and leaves appear<br/>

     With flowers in bud the meads among,<br/>

     And nightingale aloft and clear<br/>

     Lifts up his voice and pricks his song,<br/>

     Joy, joy have I in song and flower,<br/>

     Joy in myself, and in my lady more.<br/>
</p>

<p>And that may be doggerel; yet what is it but</p>

<p>     It was a lover and his lass,<br/>

     With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino,<br/>

     That o'er the green cornfield did pass<br/>

     In the spring-time, the only pretty ring-time—<br/>
</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>     When daffodils begin to peer,<br/>

     With heigh! the doxy over the dale,<br/>

     Why then comes in the sweet o' the year;<br/>

     For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.<br/>
</p>

<p>Nay, flatter the Anglo-Saxon tradition by picking its very best—and I
suppose it hard to find better than the much-admired opening of Piers
Plowman, in which that tradition shot up like the flame of a dying
candle:</p>

<p>     Bote in a Mayes Morwnynge—on Malverne hulles<br/>

     Me bi-fel a ferly—a Feyrie me thouhte;<br/>

     I was weori of wandringe—and wente me to reste<br/>

     Under a brod banke—bi a Bourne syde,<br/>

     And as I lay and leonede—and lokede on the watres,<br/>

     I slumberde in a slepynge—hit sownede so murie.<br/>
</p>

<p>This is good, solid stuff, no doubt: but tame, inert, if not actually
lifeless. As M. Jusserand says of Anglo-Saxon poetry in general, it is
like the river Saône—one doubts which way it flows. How tame in
comparison with this, for example!—</p>

<p>     In somer, when the shawes be sheyne,<br/>

     And leves be large and long,<br/>

     Hit is full mery in feyre foreste<br/>

     To here the foulys song:<br/>
</p>

<p>     To se the dere draw to the dale<br/>

     And leve the hilles hee,<br/>

     And shadow hem in the leves grene<br/>

     Under the grene-wode tre.<br/>
</p>

<p>     Hit befel on Whitsontide,<br/>

     Erly in a May mornyng,<br/>

     The Son up feyre can shyne,<br/>

     And the briddis mery can syng.<br/>
</p>

<p>     'This is a mery mornyng,' said litell John,<br/>

     'Be Hym that dyed on tre;<br/>

     A more mery man than I am one<br/>

     Lyves not in Cristianté.<br/>
</p>

<p>     'Pluk up thi hert, my dere mayster,'<br/>

     Litull John can sey,<br/>

     'And thynk hit is a full fayre tyme<br/>

     In a mornyng of May.'<br/>
</p>

<p>There is no doubting which way <i>that</i> flows! And this vivacity, this new
beat of the heart of poetry, is common to Chaucer and the humblest
ballad-maker; it pulses through any book of lyrics printed yesterday, and
it came straight to us out of Provence, the Roman Province. It was the
Provençal Troubadour who, like the Prince in the fairy tale, broke
through the hedge of briers and kissed Beauty awake again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">You will urge that he wakened Poetry not in England alone but all over
Europe, in Dante before our Chaucer, in the trouvères and minnesingers as
well as in our ballad-writers. To that I might easily retort, 'So much
the better for Europe, and the more of it the merrier, to win their way
into the great comity.' But here I put in my second assertion, that we
English have had above all nations lying wide of the Mediterranean, the
instinct to refresh and renew ourselves at Mediterranean wells; that
again and again our writers—our poets especially—have sought them as
the hart panteth after the water-brooks. If you accept this assertion,
and if you believe as well that our literature, surpassing Rome's, may
vie with that of Athens—if you believe that a literature which includes
Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Pope, Wordsworth, Shelley—the Authorised
Version of Holy Writ, with Browne, Bunyan, Swift, Addison, Johnson,
Arnold, Newman—has entered the circle to take its seat with the first—
why then, heartily believing this with you, I leave you to find some
better explanation than mine if you can.</p>

<p>But what I content myself with asserting here you can scarcely deny.
Chaucer's initial and enormous debt to Dante and Boccaccio stands in as
little dispute as Dunbar's to Chaucer. On that favourite poet of mine,
Sir Thomas Wyat, I descanted in a former lecture. He is one of your
glories here, having entered St. John's College at the age of twelve
(which must have been precocious even for those days.) Anthony Wood
asserts that after finishing his course here, he proceeded to Cardinal
Wolsey's new College at Oxford; but, as Christchurch was not founded
until 1524, and Wyat, still precocious, had married a wife two years
before that, the statement (to quote Dr Courthope) 'seems no better
founded than many others advanced by that patriotic but not very
scrupulous author.' It is more to the point that he went travelling, and
brought home from France, Italy, afterwards Spain—always from Latin
altars—the flame of lyrical poetry to England; the flame of the
Petrarchists, caught from the Troubadours, clarified (so to speak) by the
salt of humane letters. On what our Elizabethan literature owes to the
Classical revival hundreds of volumes have been written and hundreds more
will be written; I will but remind you of what Spencer talked about with
Gabriel Harvey, what Daniel disputed with Campion; that Marlowe tried to
re-incarnate Machiavelli, that Jonson was a sworn Latinist and the 'tribe
of Ben' a classical tribe; while, as for Shakespeare, go and reckon the
proportion of Italian and Roman names in his <i>dramatis personæ</i>. Of
Donne's debt to France, Italy, Rome, Greece, you may read much in
Professor Grierson's great edition, and I daresay Professor Grierson
would be the first to allow that all has not yet been computed. You know
how Milton prepared himself to be a poet. Have you realised that, in
those somewhat strangely constructed sonnets of his, Milton was
deliberately modelling upon the "Horatian Ode," as his confrère, Andrew
Marvell, was avowedly attempting the like in his famous Horation Ode on
Cromwell's Return from Ireland; so that if Cromwell had returned (like Mr
Quilp), walked in and caught his pair of Latin Secretaries scribbling
verse, one at either end of the office table, both might colourably have
pleaded that they were, after all, writing Latin. Waller's task in poetry
was to labour true classical polish where Cowley laboured sham-classical
form. Put together Dryden's various Prefaces and you will find them one
solid monument to his classical faith. Of Pope, Gray, Collins, you will
not ask me to speak. What is salt in Cowper you can taste only when you
have detected that by a stroke of madness he missed, or barely missed,
being our true English Horace, that almost more nearly than the rest he
hit what the rest had been seeking. Then, of the 'romantic revival'—
enemy of false classicism, not of classicism—bethink you what, in his
few great years, Wordsworth owed directly to France of the early
Revolution; what Keats drew forth out of Lemprière: and again bethink you
how Tennyson wrought upon Theocritus, Virgil, Catullus; upon what Arnold
constantly shaped his verse; how Browning returned ever upon Italy to
inspire his best and correct his worse.</p>

<p>Of Anglo-Saxon prose I know little indeed, but enough of the world to
feel reasonably sure that if it contained any single masterpiece—or
anything that could be paraded as a masterpiece—we should have heard
enough about it long before now. It was invented by King Alfred for
excellent political reasons; but, like other ready-made political
inventions in this country, it refused to thrive. I think it can be
demonstrated, that the true line of intellectual descent in prose lies
through Bede (who wrote in Latin, the 'universal language'), and not
through the Blickling Homilies, or, Ælfric, or the Saxon Chronicle. And I
am sure that Freeman is perversely wrong when he laments as a 'great
mistake' that the first Christian missionaries from Rome did not teach
their converts to pray and give praise in the vernacular. The vernacular
being what it was, these men did better to teach the religion of the
civilised world—<i>orbis terrarum</i>—in the language of the civilised
world. I am not thinking of its efficiency for spreading the faith; but
neither is Freeman; and, for that, we must allow these old missionaries
to have known their own business. I am thinking only of how this 'great
mistake' affected our literature; and if you will read Professor
Saintsbury's "History of English Prose Rhythm" (pioneer work, which yet
wonderfully succeeds in illustrating what our prose-writers from time to
time were trying to do); if you will study the Psalms in the Authorised
Version; if you will consider what Milton, Clarendon, Sir Thomas Browne,
were aiming at; what Addison, Gibbon, Johnson; what Landor, Thackeray,
Newman, Arnold, Pater; I doubt not your rising from the perusal convinced
that our nation, in this storehouse of Latin to refresh and replenish its
most sacred thoughts, has enjoyed a continuous blessing: that the Latin
of the Vulgate and the Offices has been a background giving depth and, as
the painters say, 'value' to nine-tenths of our serious writing.</p>

<p>And now, since this and the previous lecture run something counter to a
great deal of that teaching in English Literature which nowadays passes
most acceptably, let me avoid offence, so far as may be, by defining one
or two things I am <i>not</i> trying to do.</p>

<p>I am not persuading you to despise your linguistic descent. English is<br/>

English—our language; and all its history to be venerated by us.<br/>
</p>

<p>I am not persuading you to despise linguistic study. <i>All</i> learning is
venerable.</p>

<p>I am not persuading you to behave like Ascham, and turn English prose
into pedantic Latin; nor would I have you doubt that in the set quarrel
between Campion, who wished to divert English verse into strict classical
channels, and Daniel, who vindicated our free English way (derived from
Latin through the Provençal), Daniel was on the whole, right, Campion on
the whole, wrong: though I believe that both ways yet lie open, and we
may learn, if we study them intelligently, a hundred things from the old
classical metres.</p>

<p>I do not ask you to forget what there is of the Northmen in your blood.
If I desired this, I could not worship William Morris as I do, among the
later poets.</p>

<p>I do not ask you to doubt that the barbarian invaders from the north,
with their myths and legends, brought new and most necessary blood of
imagination into the literary material—for the time almost exhausted—of
Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I do contend that when Britain (or, if you prefer it,<br/>

Sleswick)<br/>
</p>

<p>     When Sleswick first at Heaven's command<br/>

     Arose from out the azure main,<br/>
</p>

<p>she differed from Aphrodite, that other foam-born, in sundry important
features of ear, of lip, of eye.</p>

<p>Lastly, if vehement assertions on the one side have driven me into too
vehement dissent on the other, I crave pardon; not for the dissent but
for the vehemence, as sinning against the very principle I would hold up
to your admiration—the old Greek principle of avoiding excess.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3em">But I <i>do</i> commend the patient study of Greek and Latin authors—in the
original or in translation—to all of you who would write English; and
for three reasons.</p>

<p>(1) In the first place they will correct your insularity of mind; or,
rather, will teach you to forget it. The Anglo-Saxon, it has been noted,
ever left an empty space around his houses; and that, no doubt, is good
for a house. It is not so good for the mind.</p>

<p>(2) Secondly, we have a tribal habit, confirmed by Protestant meditation
upon a Hebraic religion, of confining our literary enjoyment to the
written word and frowning down the drama, the song, the dance. A fairly
attentive study of modern lyrical verse has persuaded me that this
exclusiveness may be carried too far, and threatens to be deadening. 'I
will sing and give praise,' says the Scripture, 'with the best member
that I have'—meaning the tongue. But the old Greek was an 'all-round
man' as we say. He sought to praise and give thanks with all his members,
and to tune each to perfection. I think his way worth your considering.</p>

<p>(3) Lastly, and chiefly, I commend these classical authors to you because
they, in the European civilisation which we all inherit, conserve the
norm of literature; the steady grip on the essential; the clean outline
at which in verse or in prose—in epic, drama, history, or philosophical
treatise—a writer should aim.</p>

<p>So sure am I of this, and of its importance to those who think of
writing, that were this University to limit me to three texts on which to
preach English Literature to you, I should choose the Bible in our
Authorised Version, Shakespeare, and Homer (though it were but in a prose
translation). Two of these lie outside my marked province. Only one of
them finds a place in your English school. But Homer, who comes neither
within my map, nor within the ambit of the Tripos, would—because he most
evidently holds the norm, the essence, the secret of all—rank first of
the three for my purpose.</p>
